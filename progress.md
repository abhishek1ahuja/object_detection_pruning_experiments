Aim: to perform pruning experiments for the task of Image Classification
Dataset: Incidents Dataset
Base models: MobileNet / ResNet
Experiment: Lottery Ticket Experiment

Goal: to to replicate Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and produce pruning graphs like below as demonstrated in the project https://github.com/arjun-majumdar/Lottery_Ticket_Hypothesis-TensorFlow_2 notebook https://github.com/arjun-majumdar/Lottery_Ticket_Hypothesis-TensorFlow_2/blob/master/Conv_2_LTH_CIFAR10.ipynb

Current progress: atttempt to replicate LTH tensorflow experiment with different base model and dataset
